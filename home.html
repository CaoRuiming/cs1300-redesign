      <h1>Responsive Redesign</h1>
      <p>For this project, I decided to do something that I had wanted to do since January 2020: redesign Brown&#39;s <a
          href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1430/">Computer Vision (CSCI 1430) course website</a> to be more modern
        and pleasant to use.</p>
      <p>When I first saw the one-page website as a student taking the class, I was appalled by the sheer amount of
        scrolling needed to navigate the sections. The web page was also not optmized for mobile (phone) devices, which
        was a problem because I would often check for CSCI 1430 project releases and office hours from my phone.</p>
      <p>So here is my redesign process for the CSCI 1430 course website.</p>
      <p>You may notice that the style of this page shares similarities with that of the redesigned website. This is
        because I took the elements and style that I liked from the redesign and applied here as well!</p>
      <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="redesigned.html">Here's a link to the finished product</a> if you want to skip to the result!</p>

    <section id="observations">
      <h2>Making Observations</h2>
      <p>The original website doesn&#39;t look too bad at first glace on a laptop...</p>
      <div class="centered-img">
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1430/">
          <img alt="Screenshot of original website" src="imgs/original_website.png">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>...but things fall apart quickly on smaller sized screens.</p>
      <div class="centered-img">
        <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://cs.brown.edu/courses/csci1430/">
          <img
            alt="Screenshot of original website on phone screen"
            src="imgs/original_website_mobile.jpeg"
            style="width: auto">
        </a>
      </div>
      <p>So here are my general observations grouped by the four usability guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Usability<ul>
            <li>The website is not mobile friendly: text is small and wide tables/images cause horizontal scrolling for
              the whole page</li>
            <li>When reading tables, it can be easy to loose track of which row you&#39;re looking at (e.g. when trying to
              find a project&#39;s due date in a table row, a user can accidentally get off track and read the due date on
              a different project&#39;s row)</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Learnability<ul>
            <li>Pretty straightforward one-page website where the navbar at the top links to the various sections</li>
            <li>Small issue: the order of links in the navbar do not perfectly correspond to the order of the sections on
              the website</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Memorability<ul>
            <li>Once a user scrolls past a section header, it&#39;s hard to determine what section they&#39;re current
              viewing</li>
            <li>It&#39;s hard to memorize the exact location and order of each section of the website</li>
            <li>Once you&#39;re in a section, it&#39;s hard to remember how to get to another specific section without
              excessive scrolling</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Efficiency<ul>
            <li>Users need to scroll a lot to reach various sections of the page: this takes a lot of unecessary time and
              physical effort</li>
            <li>It&#39;s difficult to distinguish the subsections within the sections from other sections: style-wise, the
              document hierarchy is unclear (most section and subsection headings are <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code>)</li>
            <li>The only place wthin links to the main sections of the website is in the static navbar located on the very
              top of the page</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Another concern I had with the original website was its accessibility and ease of use through assistive
        technologies like screen readers. This website is a pretty simple static page, so poor usability for users with
        special accessiblity needs is not acceptable.</p>
      <p>Thus, I ran the original website through <a href="https://wave.webaim.org">WAVE</a> (web accessibility evaluation
        tool) and made the following observations of issues:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Too many fully justified paragraph blocks -- i.e. there are lost of large, solid blocks of text</li>
        <li>No language specified in the html tag</li>
        <li>No semantic html/ARIA landmarks: it&#39;s hard to distinguish the separate sections of the website through
          document structure</li>
        <li>tables lack captions that describe their contents</li>
        <li>many PowerPoint and PDF links</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Besides the last point about links to PowerPoints and PDFs, all of these issues present significant usability
        problems and will need to be fixed in the redesign. Redoing the PowerPoints and PDFs to be accessible would be a
        lot of work and out of scope for this project.</p>
      <p>I additionally ran the original website through a quick screen reader test on WAVE, and navigation throughout the
        page was possible, but cumbersome because of the sheer amount of content and lack of document structure.</p>

    <section id="prototypes">
      <h2>Making Prototypes</h2>
      <p>Before I could dive in with implementing a redesign, I made low-fidelity (lo-fi) and high-fidelity (hi-fi)
        prototypes in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://balsamiq.com">Balsamiq</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
          href="https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html">Adobe XD</a>, respectively, so that I would have a better idea of
        how the final product should look.</p>
      <p>For each set of prototypes, I made at least 3 wireframes: one for for desktop-sized screens, one for tablet-sized
        screens, and one for phone-sized screens.</p>
      <p>Because each wireframe is very tall since this is a single-page website, I will only showcase the key design
        changes with annotations here. Of course, links to the full wireframes will be provided as well.</p>
      <h3 id="low-fidelity-prototypes">Low-Fidelity Prototypes</h3>
      <p>The point of my lo-fi prototypes was to develop solutions for the problems I previously observed in the original
        website.</p>
      <p>If you would like to see/download full wireframes click on the following links:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/lofi/desktop.png">
          Desktop design</a></li>
        <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/lofi/tablet.png">

        <li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="imgs/lofi/phone.png">
          Phone design</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here are some key design choices I made in these prototypes. Note that there are no annotations for the tablet
        design since it is very similar to the desktop design.</p>
      <div class="annotations container-fluid">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <img src="imgs/lofi/1.png">
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>(Desktop) Always-visible navbar that is always located at the top of the visible window no matter how far the
              user has scrolled. As a users scrolls through various sections, the section that they are currently viewing will
              be highlighted in the navbar. This way, users can always tell where they are in the web page, and they can click
              on a section link in the navbar to jump to another section without additional scrolling.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>(Desktop) Section headers are much larger and distinct from paragraph text and subsection headers to make
              document structure clearer. No more confusion between the start of a section and the start of a subsection!</p>

          </div>
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>(Desktop) Tables will have rows with alternating colors so it&#39;s easier to follow data along rows. If a
              table is too wide for the window, the table (and only the table) will be able to be scrolled horizontally.</p>

            <p>(Mobile) The top navbar will collapse into a hamburger menu once the screen is small enough. Just like on
              desktop, the navbar will always be visble on the top of the screen, and, when the navbar is expanded, it will
              hightlight the link corresponding to the section that the user is currently viewing.</p>

            <p>(Mobile) Make the calendar embed no wider than the width of the screen and show the more compact
              &quot;agenda&quot; calendar view (not directly shown in wireframe).</p>

          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>(Mobile) Ensure that large tables have their own horizontal scroll bars and don&#39;t make the entire website
              have a horizontal scroll. This should also help fix the problem of small text because the width of the main body
              of the page will no longer be wider than the screen.</p>

        </div>
      </div>

      <p>After creating my hi-fi prototypes, I also put together a simple UI style guide to summarize the specific designs
        I used for the redesign. There&#39;s not much on here because this is a pretty straightforward website, after all.

        </a>
      </div>
      <p>I also have the following notes on style:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All maroon colors on the website (e.g. accents and link colors) are various shades of
          <code>hsl(347,100%,30%)</code>.</li>
        <li><code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> have a serif font like Garamond. Other reasonable serif fonts are also
          acceptable if Garamond is not available.</li>
        <li>All other text on the website (including the navbar and <code>h3</code>) should have a sans-serif font like
          Helvetica Neue. Other reasonable sans-serif fonts are also acceptable if Garamond is not available.</li>
        <li>The background color of the whole website should be a slightly-off-white, not pure white. This should improve
          readability of the pure black paragraph text.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="implementation">
      <h2>Implementing the Redesign</h2>
      <p>My implementation process was essentially downloading the existing static html, js, and css files of the original
        website and tweaking styling and html document layout until it solved the usability problems I had identified and
        looked close enough to the hi-fi prototypes.</p>
      <p>Click the screenshot below or <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="redesigned.html">this link</a> to see the redesigned website for CSCI 1430!</p>

      </div>
      <p>I also confirmed the usability improvements through a few tests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simulating table and phone screens on Chrome developer tools worked as expected.</li>
        <li>The website still looked great even when font size was set to 150% and the screen size was changed to that of
          a tablet&#39;s.</li>
        <li>WAVE brought up fewer accessibility issues than the original website (there were still a lot because of links
          to PowerPoints and PDFs).</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>That&#39;s it! This is definitely not the flashiest redesign, but it makes the experience of using the website
        significantly more pleasant for users on all devices </p>
      <p>As for future directions, I am hoping to get in contact with the 2021 TA staff of Computer Vision (CSCI 1430) to
        see if they will adopt my redesign!</p>
